# Changelog

## 0.4.1

Voice/talk reliability patch.

### Changed

- Kept `Camera.snapshot()` and the `snapshot` CLI on explicit `stream_type` selection instead of adding snapshot `quality` aliases.
- Snapshot payloads now keep `<fullFrame>0</fullFrame>` for both main and sub snapshot streams.
- Clarified that `Camera.record()` and the `record` CLI perform local
  MPEG-TS live-stream recording, not camera-side SD-card recording control.

### Fixed

- Reconnect once and retry when short camera commands hit a stale UDP session timeout.
- Reconnect once and retry the whole snapshot request when snapshot metadata or data waits time out.
- Reused the shared command retry path for repeated voice/talk and siren commands.
- Treat Tree360-style `MSG.FILE_PLAYBACK` response `331` as a scoped playback
  continuation so SD-card playback downloads can continue to their normal
  completion response.
- Hardened config parsing, snapshot output paths, connection-state writes, UDP
  packet decoding, and global CLI `--camera` parsing based on external fork
  review.

## 0.4.0

SD-card file API and preview playback work.

### Added

- Added `SDFile` wrappers for SD-card recordings with `info()`, `download()`, and `preview()`.
- Added `SdCard.files()` and `SdCard.file(...)` helpers.
- Added cached SD-card preview playback with an HTTP stream helper for players such as VLC.
- Updated `examples/sd_card_example.py` with list, download, preview, remove, and format examples.

### Changed

- Moved public recording downloads from `SdCard.download(file, ...)` to `SDFile.download(...)`.
- Updated README, docs, and examples to use the new SD-card file API.
- Use camera `file_name` plus the media extension for finalized download filenames.

### Fixed

- Treat camera `400` responses after partial SD-card download data as interrupted downloads so reconnect/retry handling can recover.

---

## 0.3.2

Downloader reliability improvements.

### Added

- Added `CameraConnectionError` for unrecoverable camera reconnect failures.
- Added `reconnect_retries` to `SdCard.download()` for interrupted long downloads.
- Added `rewrite_exists` to `SdCard.download()` to skip already finalized local files.
- Added IDE-friendly docstrings for SDK classes, CLI helpers, and core protocol components.

### Changed

- Treat existing non-empty `.mp4` files as complete when `rewrite_exists=False`.
- Remove stale `.part` files for a recording when the finalized `.mp4` is skipped.
- Translated internal documentation to English for publication.

---

## 0.3.1

PyPI metadata and README link update.

### Changed

- Updated package metadata and installation links for the first PyPI publication.

---

- Baichuan login, command framing, BC XOR, and AES-CFB support.
- Camera info, UID, reboot, snapshot, LED/IR compatibility commands.
- SD-card listing with pagination and high/low recording download.
- Battery status with reconnect and online polling modes.
- Live MPEG-TS stream server and HLS timeshift buffer.
- Local MPEG-TS recording from live streams.
- Motion status and motion event watch mode.
- Voice/talk from microphone, audio file, or generated tone.
